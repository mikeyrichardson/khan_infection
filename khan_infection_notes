# Infection Algorithm

Since the infection travels along both the "is coached by" and the "coaches" relationship, the total infection problem boils down to a determination of the connected components of an undirected graph where the nodes are the users and the edges are the coaching relations.

After writing the code to extract the connected components, I will use the counts of nodes in each of the connected components to implement the limited infection problem by finding a subset of the counts that adds up to approximately the desired number of infections. Depending on how close I would like to get to the target number, it could take a while for the subset selection.

Also, I need to figure out how I will partition the connected components if it turns out that too many users are grouped into large connected components. For example, if 1000 users are grouped into two components of sizes 400 and 600, but I only want to infect about 100 users, how will I decide how to break up. Maybe I'll approach the problem as a digraph problem, create a topological ordering, and then travel down the top-level coaching relationships until I find enough users. Or maybe I'll count the number of users under each coach and choose the single coach (along with descendents) who gets closest to the infection amount goal.

Time to explore for a while...
